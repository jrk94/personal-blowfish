My name is Jo√£o Roque. I like making stuff <span class="emojify">:smile:</span>. That's why I became an engineer.

I started out migrating an ERP legacy product, then I decided that I wanted to be where the fun stuff happens. I always loved understading how a factory works. How humans and machines come together to manufacture amazing things. I joined Critical Manufacturing with that vision. I wanted to give my tiny contribution to make people and machine come together in an intelligent way to create new products and services. I spent some years implementing MES projects from different industries, from Semi-Conductors, to SMT, to Medical Devices and I had a blast doing it. 

After, some years I wanted to understand if I could make it as a micro services techno babler functional language programmer and I had the amazing opportunity to work at Let's Get Checked. I learned a lot. I met an amazing group of people and new technologies that really made me think and evolve as an engineer. From Kafka, to the no sql database, to the whole AWS suite, it was a really incredible opportunity with a great team.

I decided to come back to Critical Manufacturing to work on the team responsible for the main product focused in the Internet Of Things suite that we offer. I think it was a great opportunity to grab all that experience, from the MES projects and also knowledge from outside CM to really bring the team to a new level and deliver some new and exciting products.

At the moment I work as a part of the Architectures and Advocates, focused in Automation and Connectivity for Critical Manfacturing.
